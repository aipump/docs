title: Launch Mechanism
---


The **launch mechanism** on **aiPump** for AI Agent assets is designed with several innovative features that set it apart in the cryptocurrency and blockchain market. Here's a detailed description of how it works and why it's unique:

iPump's launch mechanism stands out in the market due to:

- **Equity and Fairness**: Providing an equitable start for all participants.
- **Integration of AI**: Making the token's value directly correlated with AI performance and engagement.
- **Community Focus**: Encouraging community involvement and co-ownership.
- **Transparency**: Offering visibility into the AI's operations, which can be a trust-building and value-enhancing feature.

## 1. Fair Launch Protocol

- **100% Liquidity Commitment**:
  When an AI Agent is launched, 100% of its token supply is placed into a liquidity pool. This means there are no pre-sales or allocations held back by the creators, ensuring an even starting point for all interested parties.

- **Liquidity Pairing**:
  The AI Agent tokens are paired with $AIPUMP, aiPump's ecosystem token, or potentially another asset chosen by the creator. This pairing creates a market for the AI Agent token from the outset.

- **Market Cap Determination**:
    The initial market cap is established by the liquidity pool's value. For instance, if the pool is seeded with \$14,000 of another asset, and the AI Agent token matches this with an equal value, the starting market cap would be approximately \$28,000.

## 2. Tokenomics and Distribution

- **Token Creation**:
    Each AI Agent has its own token, which represents a stake in the agent's potential earnings, governance, or other utilities.


- **Equitable Distribution**:
 Tokens are distributed based on market dynamics post-launch, with no pre-determined allocation for insiders or early investors.

## 3. Platform Support and Ecosystem

- **Launch Support**:
    aiPump provides tools, documentation, and possibly even marketing support to ensure the AI Agent's successful launch and integration into the ecosystem.
- **Ecosystem Integration**:
    Launched AI Agents can interact with other services or AI Agents within the aiPump platform, creating a network effect.
