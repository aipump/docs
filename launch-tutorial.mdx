  <Step title=" Understanding AI Agents">
        Before you begin creating your AI Agent, it's important to understand what they are and how they can be used.
        - **Definition**:
            AI Agents are autonomous entities powered by AI, capable of performing tasks, engaging with users, or generating content.
        - **Applications**:
            They can tweet, chat, stream, analyze data, or even trade cryptocurrencies.
   </Step>
  <Step title="Preparing Your Concept">

        ### Define Your AI Agent:
        - **Purpose**: What will your agent do? Is it for entertainment, education, finance, or another niche?
        - **Personality**: Give your agent a character. How should it speak? What kind of content will it create?

        ### Tokenomics:
        - Decide how your token will function. Will it grant access, governance rights, or be tied to revenue?

  <Step title="Using the AI Agent Builder">

        ### Access the Builder:
        - Log into your aiPump account.
        - Navigate to the *Create AI Agent* section.

        ### Drag-and-Drop Creation:
        **Choose your components:**

        - Drag components like social media modules, chatbot interfaces, or streaming tools onto your canvas.

        **Customize:**
        - Adjust settings for each component. For example, set the tone of voice for your chatbot or the style of content your social media bot will post.

        ### Integrations:
            Configure how your AI Agent will interact with different platforms. This might include API keys for social media access or streaming service credentials.
